# Trust and Security with Google Cloud

# Trust and Security in the Cloud
## Key security terms and concepts
- Reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data:
    - Privileged access -> grants specific users access to a broader set of resources than ordinary users
    - Least privilege -> granting users only the access they need to perform their job responsibilities
    - Zero-trust architecture -> assumes that no user or device can be trusted by default. Every user and device must be authenticated and authorized before accessing resources. 
- How an organization can protect itself from cyber threats:
    - Security by default -> a principle that emphasizes integrating security measures into systems and applications from the initial stages of development
    - Security posture -> the overall security status of a cloud environment. It indicates how well an organization is prepared to defend against cyber attacks by evaluating their security controls, policies and practices
    - Cyber resilience -> an organization's ability to withstand and recover quickly from cyber attacks. It involves identifying, assessing and mitigating risks responding to incidents effectively and recovering from disruptions quickly. 
- Essential security measures to protect cloud resources from unauthorized access:
    - Firewall -> is a network device that regulates traffic based on predefined security rules
    - Encryption -> the process of converting data into an unreadable format by using an encryption algorithm
    - Decryption -> the reverse process that uses an encryption key to restore encrypted data back to to its original form
        - Safeguarding the encryption key is crutial, because it holds the secret algorithm necessary for decrypting the data.


## Cloud security components
- 3 essential aspects of security. These 3 principles form the foundation of the "CIA Triad", a widly used model for developing effective security systems.
    - Confidentiality -> is about keeping important information safe and secret. It ensures that only authorized people can access sensitive data, no matter where it's stored or sent.
    - Integrity -> keeping data accurate and trustworthy. It ensures that information doesn't get changed or corrupted, no matter where it's stored or how it's moved around.
    - Availability -> is about making sure that cloud systems and services are always accessible and ready for use by the right people when needed.
- The CIA triad emphasizes the importance of protecting sensitive information, ensuring data accuracy and trustworthiness, and maintaining uninterrumpted access to resources and services
- Control: 
    - the measures and processes implemented to manage and mitigate security risks. 
    - It involves establishing policies, procedures, and technical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access, misuse and potential threats. 
    - Control measures in the cloud include implementing robust authentication mechanisms, access restrictions, and security awareness training.
- Compliance:
    - relates to adhering to industry regulations, legal requirements, and organizational policies.
    - it involves ensuring that security practices and measures align with established standards and guidelines.
    - cloud providers often offer compliance frameworks and certifications that organizations can leverage to meet their regulatory obligations.


## Cloud security versus traditional on-premises security
- Differences:
    - Location: 
        - cloud security involves hosting and managing data and applications in off-site data centers operated by cloud service providers. The responsibility for securing the infrastructure and underlying hardware lies with the cloud provider.
        - traditional on-premises security involves hosting and managing data and applications locally on as organization's own servers and infrastructure, granting direct control and responsability for securing the physical and virtual environment.
    - Responsability:
        - in a cloud model, the cloud service provider is responsible for securing the infrastructure, network and physical facilities. The customer is typically responsible for securing their data, applications, user access and configurations.
        - in an on-premises setup, the organization is responsible for securing the entire infrastructure, including hardare, network, operating systems, applications and data.
    - Scalability:
        - cloud security offers scalability and elasticity, which allows organizations to easily scale their resources up or down based on demand. This flexibility is suitable for dynamic workloads and rapid growth.
        - on-premises security requires organizations to provision and maintain their own infrastructure, which can be more time consuming and costly when they scale up or down
    - Maintenance and updates
        - cloud service providers handle infrastructure maintenance, including security updates, patching and software upgrades.
        - on-premises environments require organizations to maintain and update their own infrastructure, involving regular tasks such as patching, software updates and hardware upgrades.
    - Capital expenditure
        - cloud security follows an operational expenditure (OpEx) model, where organizations pay for the services they consume of a subscription basis. This elimitantes the need for large upfront capital investments in physical security infrastrucute.
        - traditional on-premises security models involve significant capital expenditure (CapEx) because organizations must purchase and maintain their own security infrastructure


## Cybersecurity threats
- Deceptive social engineering:
    - these cybercriminals emplow "phising attacks", which collect personal details about someone.
    - they skillfully craft tailored emails and mimic authenticity to deceive their targets.
    - anyone within the organization can be tricked into inadvertently downloading malicious attachments, divulging passwords or compromising sensitive data.
- Physical damage:
    - Damage to hardware components
    - power disruptions
    - natural disasters such as floods, fires and earthquakes
- Malware, viruses and ransomware:
    - employing malicious software, they aim to disrupt operations, inflict damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems
    - the most insidious of these is ransomware, where crucial files are held hostage until a considerable ransom is paid
- Vulnerable third-party systems:
    - many organizations rely on third-party systems for essential functions such as finance, inventory management, or account operations
    - however, without adequate security measusres and regular evaluations, these systems can transform into potential threats, leaving data secutiry vulnerable.
- Configuration mishaps
    - misconfiguration occurs when errors arise during the setup or configuration of resources, which inadvertently exposes sensitive data and systems to unauthorized access.
    - surveys consistently identify misconfiguration as the most prominent threat to cloud security.
    - adopting principles of least privilege and privileged access are imperative, because they allow resource access only when explicitly required and authorized.

## Secure storage
- When data is at rest, it's stored on physical devices like computers or servers
- By encrypting data at rest, even if someone gains physical access to the device, they won't be able to decipher data without the encryption key
- Google Cloud automatically encrypts all customer content at rest. It's a free and built in feature.
- Key Cloud management service (Cloud KMS) allows users to manage their encryption keys.
- Google Cloud employs robust security measures to ensure the authenticity, integrity and privacy of the users data during transit:
    - they encrypt and authenticate data at multiple network layers, especially when it travels outside the physical boundaries they control.
- Data in use: data being actively processed by a computer
- Encrypting data in use adds another layer of protection, especially against unauthorized users who might physically access the computer
- Google uses a technique called memory encryption which locks the users data inside the computer's memory, making it nearly impossible for unauthorized users to gain access to it.
- Encryption Algorithms:
    - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) -> is a powerful encryption algorithm trusted by governments and businesses worldwide. I


## Identity
- Important aspects of cloud identity management used to ensure secure access, manage user privileges and monitor resource usage (3 A's):
    - Authentication
        - serves as the gatekeeper, because it verifies the identity of users or systems that seek access
        - involves presenting unique credentials, such as passwords, physical tokens or biometric data like fingerprints or recognition.
        - Two step verification/ Two-factor authentication/ Multi-factor authentication:
            - security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to cloud-based systems
            - with it enabled, users need to provide 2 different pieces of information to log in
    - Authorization
        - After the user's identity is authenticated, authorization steps in to determine what that user or system is allowed to do within the system
        - It's like the access control mechanism
        - Different permissions are assigned to individuals or groups based on their roles, responsabilities, and organizational hierarchy.
    - Auditing
        - sometimes refered as acciunting
        - plays a critical role in monitoring and tracking user activities within a system
        - By collecting and analysing logs of the user activity, system events and other data, auditing helps organizations detect anomalies, security breaches and policy violations.
        - It provides a comprehensive record of actions taken on a system or resource, which proves invaluable during security incident investigations, compliance tracking, and system performance evaluation.
- Identity and Access Management (IAM): 
    - provides granular control over who has access to Google Cloud resources and what they can do with those resources
    - provides a centralized and efficient approach to managing access control within users Google Cloud environment
    - By integrating IAM into your Google Cloud security strategy, you can ensure fine-grained access control, enhanced visibility, and centralized resource management


## Network security

    - Secure your connections to on-premises and multi-cloud environments
        - Google Cloud privides private access methods through services like Cloud VPN and Cloud Interconnect, which let you establish secure connections between your on-premises networks and Google Cloud resources
    - Protect your perimeter with Google Cloud's powerful tools:
        - Google Cloud offers methods to help secure users perimeters including :
            - firewalls and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Service Controls -> helps divide the cloud into different sections and keep them secure:
            - Shared VCP -> is like having a large dence that separates each Google Cloud Project, so they can work independently and safely
    - Stay ahead with a web application firewall:
        - External web applications and services are often targeted by cyber threats, including DDoS(distributed denial-of-service) attacks -> is a cyber attack that uses multiple compromised computer systems to flood a target with more traffic than it can handle, which causes a denial of service to legitimate users.
        - Google Cloud Armor comes to the rescue by providing robust DDoS protection
    - Automate infrastucture provisioning for enhanced security
        - by adopring automation tools, users can create immutable infrastructure, which means that it can't be changed after provisioning.
        - Terraform, Jenkins and Cloud Build are some tools that handle all the behind-the-scenes work to create a secure and reliable cloud environment.


## Security operations
- SecOps (Security Operations):
    - is about protecting organizations data and systems in the cloud
    - it involves a combination of processes and technologies that help reduce the risk of data breaches, system outages and other security incidents.
    - Essential activities involved in SecOps:
