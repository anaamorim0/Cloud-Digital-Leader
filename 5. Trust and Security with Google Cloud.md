# Trust and Security with Google Cloud

# Trust and Security in the Cloud
## Key security terms and concepts
- Reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data:
    - Privileged access -> grants specific users access to a broader set of resources than ordinary users
    - Least privilege -> granting users only the access they need to perform their job responsibilities
    - Zero-trust architecture -> assumes that no user or device can be trusted by default. Every user and device must be authenticated and authorized before accessing resources. 
- How an organization can protect itself from cyber threats:
    - Security by default -> a principle that emphasizes integrating security measures into systems and applications from the initial stages of development
    - Security posture -> the overall security status of a cloud environment. It indicates how well an organization is prepared to defend against cyber attacks by evaluating their security controls, policies and practices
    - Cyber resilience -> an organization's ability to withstand and recover quickly from cyber attacks. It involves identifying, assessing and mitigating risks responding to incidents effectively and recovering from disruptions quickly. 
- Essential security measures to protect cloud resources from unauthorized access:
    - Firewall -> is a network device that regulates traffic based on predefined security rules
    - Encryption -> the process of converting data into an unreadable format by using an encryption algorithm
    - Decryption -> the reverse process that uses an encryption key to restore encrypted data back to to its original form
        - Safeguarding the encryption key is crutial, because it holds the secret algorithm necessary for decrypting the data.


## Cloud security components
- 3 essential aspects of security. These 3 principles form the foundation of the "CIA Triad", a widly used model for developing effective security systems.
    - Confidentiality -> is about keeping important information safe and secret. It ensures that only authorized people can access sensitive data, no matter where it's stored or sent.
    - Integrity -> keeping data accurate and trustworthy. It ensures that information doesn't get changed or corrupted, no matter where it's stored or how it's moved around.
    - Availability -> is about making sure that cloud systems and services are always accessible and ready for use by the right people when needed.
- The CIA triad emphasizes the importance of protecting sensitive information, ensuring data accuracy and trustworthiness, and maintaining uninterrumpted access to resources and services
- Control: 
    - the measures and processes implemented to manage and mitigate security risks. 
    - It involves establishing policies, procedures, and technical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access, misuse and potential threats. 
    - Control measures in the cloud include implementing robust authentication mechanisms, access restrictions, and security awareness training.
- Compliance:
    - relates to adhering to industry regulations, legal requirements, and organizational policies.
    - it involves ensuring that security practices and measures align with established standards and guidelines.
    - cloud providers often offer compliance frameworks and certifications that organizations can leverage to meet their regulatory obligations.


## Cloud security versus traditional on-premises security
- Differences:
    - Location: 
        - cloud security involves hosting and managing data and applications in off-site data centers operated by cloud service providers. The responsibility for securing the infrastructure and underlying hardware lies with the cloud provider.
        - traditional on-premises security involves hosting and managing data and applications locally on as organization's own servers and infrastructure, granting direct control and responsability for securing the physical and virtual environment.
    - Responsability:
        - in a cloud model, the cloud service provider is responsible for securing the infrastructure, network and physical facilities. The customer is typically responsible for securing their data, applications, user access and configurations.
        - in an on-premises setup, the organization is responsible for securing the entire infrastructure, including hardare, network, operating systems, applications and data.
    - Scalability:
        - cloud security offers scalability and elasticity, which allows organizations to easily scale their resources up or down based on demand. This flexibility is suitable for dynamic workloads and rapid growth.
        - on-premises security requires organizations to provision and maintain their own infrastructure, which can be more time consuming and costly when they scale up or down
    - Maintenance and updates
        - cloud service providers handle infrastructure maintenance, including security updates, patching and software upgrades.
        - on-premises environments require organizations to maintain and update their own infrastructure, involving regular tasks such as patching, software updates and hardware upgrades.
    - Capital expenditure
        - cloud security follows an operational expenditure (OpEx) model, where organizations pay for the services they consume of a subscription basis. This elimitantes the need for large upfront capital investments in physical security infrastrucute.
        - traditional on-premises security models involve significant capital expenditure (CapEx) because organizations must purchase and maintain their own security infrastructure


## Cybersecurity threats
- Deceptive social engineering:
    - these cybercriminals emplow "phising attacks", which collect personal details about someone.
    - they skillfully craft tailored emails and mimic authenticity to deceive their targets.
    - anyone within the organization can be tricked into inadvertently downloading malicious attachments, divulging passwords or compromising sensitive data.
- Physical damage:
    - Damage to hardware components
    - power disruptions
    - natural disasters such as floods, fires and earthquakes
- Malware, viruses and ransomware:
    - employing malicious software, they aim to disrupt operations, inflict damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems
    - the most insidious of these is ransomware, where crucial files are held hostage until a considerable ransom is paid
- Vulnerable third-party systems:
    - many organizations rely on third-party systems for essential functions such as finance, inventory management, or account operations
    - however, without adequate security measusres and regular evaluations, these systems can transform into potential threats, leaving data secutiry vulnerable.
- Configuration mishaps
    - misconfiguration occurs when errors arise during the setup or configuration of resources, which inadvertently exposes sensitive data and systems to unauthorized access.
    - surveys consistently identify misconfiguration as the most prominent threat to cloud security.
    - adopting principles of least privilege and privileged access are imperative, because they allow resource access only when explicitly required and authorized.

# Google's Trusted Infrastructure
## Data centers
- They are the backbone of round-the-clock operations for Google's services, including Search, Gmail and Youtube and they play a crucial role in storing and processing data for all the services provided on Google Cloud.
- These advanced facilities are meticulously designed to deliver:
    - exceptional reliability
    - top-notch security
    - outstanding efficiency
    - minimizing the environmental impact of data centers by using cutting edge technologies and renewable energy sources, we strive to reduce our ecological footprint
- Benefits of Google designing and building its own data centers, using purpose-built servers, advanced networking solutions, and custom security hardware and software:
    - the implementation of a zero-trust architecture, which ensures enhanced security at every level. Our custom hardware and software are purpose-built with:
        - tamper-evident hardware
        - secure boot
        - hardware-based encryption
    - physical security, with robust access control measures and biometric authentication in place. By adopting the principle of least privilege, only authorized personnel have access to the data centers, which minimizes the risk of physical breaches and maintains a privileged access framework.
    - data centers embody the concept of security by default (From the moment you step into a Google data center, you can trust that every aspect has been designed and implemented with your security in mind.)
    - efficiency: purpose-built servers are optimized for specific tasks, which allows them to perform at great speed and with exceptional efficiency. This reduces energy consumption, cuts down on operating costs, and saves resources and the environment. Google measures there success through the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) score.
    - Scalability: Our data centers can quickly and seamlessly accommodate new hardware and servers, which allows us to scale up computing resources on demand. This flexibility is critical for Google to handle massive data volumes and traffic without any disruptions to services
