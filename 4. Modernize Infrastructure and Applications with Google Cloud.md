# Modernize Infrastructure and Applications with Google Cloud

## Important cloud migration terms
- Workload:
    - In cloud computing, a workload is a specific application, service or capability that can be run in the Cloud or on premises. 
    - It can include containers, databases, and virtual machines.
- Retired:
    - A workload can be retired = removed from a platform
    - A workload might be retired because it's unnecessary, not cost effective, secure, or compatible with a specific platform
- Retained:
    - Retaining a workload means that it's intentionally kept.
    - When a workload is retained, it's typically kept on premises or in a hybrid Cloud environment. This means that it will continue to be managed by the business and will not be subject to the same level of Cloud provider control.
- Rehost:
    - The migration of a workload to the Cloud without changing anything in the workload's code or architecture. 
    - This process is often referred to as lift and shift.
    - Drawbacks: it doesn't use all the benefits of Cloud computing, managing workloads that were rehosted without making any changes can be difficult, scaling workloads that were re hosted without making any changes can also be difficult.
- Replatform:
    - The process of migrating a workload to the Cloud while making some changes to the workloads code or architecture.
    - This process is often called move and improve
    - It let's organizations benefit from the Cloud's scalabiliy, reliabilty and cost effectiveness, improve the performance of their workloads and reduce the cost of their workloads. 
    - Drawbacks: it can be a complex and consuming process. Making the necessary changes to the workload's code or architecture can be difficult and testing the changes to the worload's code or architecture can also be difficult
- Refactored:
    - The process of changing the code of a workload
    - Benefits: it means that workload can be become more efficient, scalable, or secure, and a valuable investment for organizations that want to use all Cloud capabilities. 
    - Drawback: refactoring a workload can be a complex and time consuming process
- Reimagined:
    - The process of rethinking how an organization uses technology to achive its business goals.
    - This can involve reconsidering the organization's current Cloud strategy and its use of other technologies such as AI and MK
    - It can help organizations to improve their efficency, reduce costs, and increase agility.


# Modernizing Infrastructure in the Cloud
## The benefits of running compute workloads in the cloud 
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
    - Measure of the total cost of a system or solution over its lifetime.
    - It includes the cost of the initial purchase, maintenance and operation, along with any other associated costs. 
    - Cloud computing can help businesses save money on IT costs by eliminating the need to purchase and maintain physical infrastructure.
    - Cloud provides a pay-as-you-go model and discounts for long term commitments.
- Scalability
    - The ability to increase or decrease the number of resources such as servers, storage and bandwidth 
    - It provides a means to meet changing demand without having to make large upfront investments in infrastructure.
- Reliability
    - Cloud providers offer a high degree of reliability and up-time, which gives the businesses confidence that their data and applications will be available when they need them. 
    - Ex: Goolge cloud has multiple data centers located in different parts of the world so that one data center goes down, the others can continue to operate.
- Security
    - Could computing providers offer a high level of security for data and applications.
    - In addition to physical data center security, cloud security features include data encryption, identity and access management, network security, virtual private Clouds, and monitoring services that can detect and respond to security threats in real time.
    - These security features can also help to ensure compliance with government or industry regulations.
- Flexibility
    - Organizations can choose the Cloud services that best meet their needs at any point in time, and then change or adapt those services when necessary.
- Abstraction 
    - How Cloud providers remove the need for customers to understant the finer details of the infrastructure implementation by providing management of the hardware, software and certain aspects of security and networking.


## Virtual machines
- Virtualization = form of resource optimization that lets multiple systems run on the same hardware.
- These systems are called Virtual Machines (VMs)
- They share the same pool of processing, storage and networking resources.
- VMs enable organizations to run multiple applications at the same time on a server in a way that it is efficient and manageable.
- Compute Engine is Google Cloud's IaaS product that lets users create and run VMs.
- There are no upfront investiments, and thousands of virtual CPUs can run on a system that's designed to be fast and to offer consistent performance. 
- It can be configured like a physical server by specifying the amount of CPU power and memory needed, the amount and type of storage needed and the operating system. 
- The VM instance can be created through the Google Cloud console or the Google CLI command line interface
- API (Application programming interface) = set of instructions that allows different software programs to communicate with each other.
- When a VM is used, Compute Engine bills by the second with a one-minute minimum, and sustained-use discounts start to apply automatically to virtual machines the longer they run. It also offers commited-use discounts.
- Preemptible or Spot VMs can be used id the workload doesn't require a human to sit and wait for it to finish.
- Spot VMs differ from Preemptible VMs by offering more features.
- Compute Engine lets users choose the machine properties of their instances, like the number of virtual CPUs, the operating system, and the amount of memory, by using a set of predefined machine types, or by creating custom machine types.


## Containers
- Containers provide isolated environments to run software services and optimize resources from one piece of hardware.
- They are more efficient than virtual machines.
- The main difference between VMs and Containers is that VMs virtualize an entire machine down to the hardware layers. Whereas containers only virtualize software layers above the operating system level.
- They start faster and use a fraction of the memory compared to VMs.
- Containers can be idependently developed, tested and deployed and are well suited for a microservices based architecture.
- Containers let developers create predictable environments isolated from other system resources.
- They can run virtually and anywhere


## Managing containers
- Containers improve agility, securiy, optimize resources and simplify managing applications in the cloud.
- Many organizations have a mix of VMs and containers.
- Kubernetes => open-source platform for managing containerized workloads as services (originally developed by Google)
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a Google hosted, managed Kubernetes service in the Cloud.
- the GKE environment consists of multiple machines, specifically compute engine instances grouped to form a cluster.
- GKE clusters can be customized and they support different machine types, number of nodes and network settings.
- Google Kubernets Engine Autopilot is a mode that enables full management of an entire cluster's infrastructure and provides per-pod billing.
- Google Run => a fully managed serverless platform to deploy and run containerized applications without needing to worry about the underlying infrastructure. After the application code is containerized and deployed to Cloud Run, Google Cloud takes care of scaling and managing the infrastructure automatically.
- Cloud Run is ideal for running stateless applications that need to scale up and down quickly in response to traffic.
- GKE is ideal when lots of control is required over a Kubernetes Environment and there are complex applications to run.
- Cloud Run is ideal for when a simple, fully managed serverless platform that can scale up and down quickly is required.


## Serverless Computing
- Another option for modernizing Cloud applications is serverless computing
- Serverless computing doesn't mean there's no server, it means that resources like compute power are automatically provisioned in the background as needed.
- Serverless means that businesses provide the code for whatever function they want and the public Cloud provider does everything else.
- One type of serverless computing solution is called function as a service.
- Google Cloud offers many serverless computing products:
    - Cloud Run: a fully managed environment for running containerized applications.
    - Cloud Run functions: the platform for hosting simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your Cloud infrastructure and services.
    - App Engine: a service to build and deploy web applications.
- Benefits:
    - Reduced operational costs
    - Scalability
    - Faster time to market
    - Reduce development costs
    - Improved resilience
    - Pay-per-use pricing model


# Modernizing Applications in the Cloud
## The benefits of modern cloud application development
- Benefits:
    - Architecture: modern cloud applications are typically built as a collection of microservices. Microservices are independently deployable, scalable and maintainable components that can be used to build a wide range of applications.
    - Deployment: modern applications are typically deployed to the cloud and can use managed or partially managed services. Partially managed services offer a hybrid approach, where businesses manage some aspects of their cloud-based applications themselves and the cloud provider manages others.
    - Cost: modern cloud applications use a pay as you go pricing model, which can make them extremely cost effective when configured efficiently. That means that organizations don't always need to pay for resources they aren't fully utilizing.
    - Scalability: Modern cloud-based applications can easily be scaled up or down to meet user demands.
    - Automatic failover: is a process that allows a cloud-based application to automatically switch to a backup server if a failure occurs.


## Rehosting Legacy Applications in the cloud
- Rehost a migration path, commonly referred to as lift and shift - an application is moved from an  on-premises environment to a cloud environment without making  any changes to the application itself.
- Drawbacks: 
    - Complexity - Businesses need to carefully  plan the migration process and ensure   that they have the right resources in place.
    - Risk - Businesses  need to carefully assess and identify potential risks and ensure that they have  a plan in place in case of any problems.
    - Vendor lock-in: by moving applications to the  cloud, businesses might become locked into a   particular cloud provider.
- Solutions for  rehosting specialized legacy applications:
    - Google Cloud VMware Engine - it helps migrate existing VMware workloads to the cloud without having to rearchitect  the applications or retool operations.
    - Bare Metal Solution - fully managed cloud infrastructure  solution that lets organizations run their Oracle workloads on dedicated,  bare metal servers in the cloud.


## Application programming interfaces (APIs)
- An API is a set of instructions that lets different software programs communicate with each other. It's like an intermediary between two different programs, which provides a standardized and predictable way for them to exchange data and interact.
- An API takes requests from one software program, communicates with another program and then returns a response, back to the requesting program.
- It lets developers access funcionality and data from another programs having to write all the code themselves, saving time and effort. 
- APIs can be used to create new products and services. 
- APIs can be used to:
    - allow developers to access data from a database
    - generate new revenue streams
    - create partnerships


## Apigee API Management
- Apigee API Management - Google Cloud's API management service to operate API's with enhanced scaled security and automation.
- Benefits:
    - It helps organizations secure their API's by providing features such as authentication, authorization and data encryption.
    - It tracks and analyses API usage with real time analytics and historical reporting
    - It helps with developing and deploying APIs through a visual API editor and a test sandbox.
    - It offers API versioning, API documentation, and even API throttling, which is the process of limiting the number of API requests a user can make in a certain period.


## Hybrid and multi-cloud
- A hybrid cloud environment comprises some combination of on premises or private cloud infratructure and public cloud services.
- A multi-cloud environment is where an organization uses multiple public cloud providers as part of its architecture. This is ideal for organizations that need flexibility and secure connectivity between the different networks.
- An organization might choose to use a hybrid cloud, a multi-cloud or a combination of both. This lets organizations:
    - Keep parts of the system's infrastructure on premises while they move other parts to the cloud.
    - Move only specific workloads to the cloud.
    - Add specialized services such as ML, content caching, data analysis, long term storage and IOT(Internet of Things) to the organization's computing resources toolkit.
- GKE Enterprise - Google's answer to modern hybrid and Multi-cloud distributed systems and services management. It is a managed production ready platform for running Kubernetes applications across multiple cloud environments. 
- Benefits of GKE enterprise:
    - Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud support
    - centralized management
    - security and compliance
    - networking and load balancing
    - monitoring and logging
